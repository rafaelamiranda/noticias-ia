      <title>Flawed AI benchmarks put enterprise budgets at risk</title>
      <link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/flawed-ai-benchmarks-enterprise-budgets-at-risk/</link>
      <description>A new academic review suggests AI benchmarks are flawed, potentially leading an enterprise to make high-stakes decisions on “misleading” data. Enterprise leaders are committing budgets of eight or nine figures to generative AI programmes. These procurement and development decisions often rely on public leaderboards and benchmarks to compare model capabilities. A large-scale study, ‘Measuring what […]
